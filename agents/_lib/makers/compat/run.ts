 * Re-sending it each time was a sandbox write buying nothing.

 * handed "exit status 2" and nothing else. That reads like a broken sandbox
 * rather than a project to fix — the run that prompted this spent one turn
 * checking the CLI version and another guessing at a file before it landed on
 * the one the lint had already named. Echoing the status keeps the shell
 * successful, which is what lets the report travel as text.

 * the parser fetches before the restoring shim can exist — that one has to be
 * relative, and it is the only root-absolute path still rejected here.
 *
